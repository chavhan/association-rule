Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
association_assingments- Script file in R language covering book/groceries/my_movies dataset scenario 
Arules_observation - Report file which demonstrate my approach towards result for book/groceries/my_movies dataset
analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on book/groceries/my_movies dataset

objective:- 
Prepare rules for the all the data sets 
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots 


Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot of both the datasets.
